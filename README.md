# STEAM-Labz Codex Terminal - Updated Documentation

## Overview
STEAM-Labz Codex Terminal is a browser-based terminal application that runs Codex with STEAM-Labz branding. It provides a user-friendly interface for interacting with Codex through a terminal-like experience directly in the browser.

## Features
- Interactive terminal interface using standard web components
- STEAM-Labz branded design with official colors (#1a5b8e, #ff6b35, #007d8c)
- File explorer panel for simulated file system navigation
- Security approval system with multiple modes (suggest, auto-edit, full-auto)
- Responsive design for both desktop and mobile devices
- Simulated Codex API integration (ready for real OpenAI API integration)

## Usage
1. Visit the application at: https://pflimypj.manus.space
2. Enter your OpenAI API key in the settings panel (left sidebar)
3. Select your preferred approval mode:
   - Suggest: Requires approval for all Codex operations
   - Auto Edit: Automatically applies edits but requires approval for commands
   - Full Auto: Executes all Codex operations without approval
4. Use the terminal with commands like:
   - `help` - Display available commands
   - `clear` - Clear the terminal
   - `version` - Show Codex version
   - `about` - About STEAM-Labz Codex Terminal
   - `codex <prompt>` - Run a Codex command

## Example Codex Commands
- `codex explain React hooks`
- `codex create a simple todo app`
- `codex fix this code: function getData() { let x; api.fetch().then(res => x = res); return x; }`

## Technical Implementation
The application is built using:
- Next.js 15.1.4 for the framework
- Standard HTML/CSS/JavaScript components for the terminal interface
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- TypeScript for type safety
- React hooks for state management

## Implementation Notes
The application was initially built using xterm.js for terminal emulation, but due to compatibility issues with static site generation, we switched to a custom implementation using standard web components. This approach ensures the application works reliably in all environments without client-side exceptions.

## Deployment
The application is deployed as a static website at:
https://pflimypj.manus.space

## Future Enhancements
- Integration with the actual OpenAI API
- Real file system operations
- User authentication and session persistence
- History of previous Codex interactions
- Code editor integration

## Quickstart

Install globally:

```shell
npm install -g @openai/codex
```

Next, set your OpenAI API key as an environment variable:

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"
```

> **Note:** This command sets the key only for your current terminal session. To make it permanent, add the `export` line to your shell's configuration file (e.g., `~/.zshrc`).

Run interactively:

```shell
codex
```

Or, run with a prompt as input (and optionally in `Full Auto` mode):

```shell
codex "explain this codebase to me"
```

```shell
codex --approval-mode full-auto "create the fanciest todo-list app"
```

That’s it – Codex will scaffold a file, run it inside a sandbox, install any
missing dependencies, and show you the live result. Approve the changes and
they’ll be committed to your working directory.

---

## Why Codex?

Codex CLI is built for developers who already **live in the terminal** and want
ChatGPT‑level reasoning **plus** the power to actually run code, manipulate
files, and iterate – all under version control. In short, it’s _chat‑driven
development_ that understands and executes your repo.

- **Zero setup** — bring your OpenAI API key and it just works!
- **Full auto-approval, while safe + secure** by running network-disabled and directory-sandboxed
- **Multimodal** — pass in screenshots or diagrams to implement features ✨

And it's **fully open-source** so you can see and contribute to how it develops!

---

## Security Model & Permissions

Codex lets you decide _how much autonomy_ the agent receives and auto-approval policy via the
`--approval-mode` flag (or the interactive onboarding prompt):

| Mode                      | What the agent may do without asking            | Still requires approval                                         |
| ------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Suggest** <br>(default) | • Read any file in the repo                     | • **All** file writes/patches <br>• **All** shell/Bash commands |
| **Auto Edit**             | • Read **and** apply‑patch writes to files      | • **All** shell/Bash commands                                   |
| **Full Auto**             | • Read/write files <br>• Execute shell commands | –                                                               |

In **Full Auto** every command is run **network‑disabled** and confined to the
current working directory (plus temporary files) for defense‑in‑depth. Codex
will also show a warning/confirmation if you start in **auto‑edit** or
**full‑auto** while the directory is _not_ tracked by Git, so you always have a
safety net.

Coming soon: you’ll be able to whitelist specific commands to auto‑execute with
the network enabled, once we’re confident in additional safeguards.

### Platform sandboxing details

The hardening mechanism Codex uses depends on your OS:

- **macOS 12+** – commands are wrapped with **Apple Seatbelt** (`sandbox-exec`).

  - Everything is placed in a read‑only jail except for a small set of
    writable roots (`$PWD`, `$TMPDIR`, `~/.codex`, etc.).
  - Outbound network is _fully blocked_ by default – even if a child process
    tries to `curl` somewhere it will fail.

- **Linux** – we recommend using Docker for sandboxing, where Codex launches itself inside a **minimal
  container image** and mounts your repo _read/write_ at the same path. A
  custom `iptables`/`ipset` firewall script denies all egress except the
  OpenAI API. This gives you deterministic, reproducible runs without needing
  root on the host. You can read more in [`run_in_container.sh`](./codex-cli/scripts/run_in_container.sh)

Both approaches are _transparent_ to everyday usage – you still run `codex` from your repo root and approve/reject steps as usual.

## System Requirements

| Requirement                 | Details                                                         |
| --------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Operating systems           | macOS 12+, Ubuntu 20.04+/Debian 10+, or Windows 11 **via WSL2** |
| Node.js                     | **22 or newer** (LTS recommended)                               |
| Git (optional, recommended) | 2.23+ for built‑in PR helpers                                   |
| RAM                         | 4‑GB minimum (8‑GB recommended)                                 |

> Never run `sudo npm install -g`; fix npm permissions instead.

## CLI Reference

| Command        | Purpose                             | Example                              |
| -------------- | ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| `codex`        | Interactive REPL                    | `codex`                              |
| `codex "…"`    | Initial prompt for interactive REPL | `codex "fix lint errors"`            |
| `codex -q "…"` | Non‑interactive "quiet mode"        | `codex -q --json "explain utils.ts"` |

Key flags: `--model/-m`, `--approval-mode/-a`, and `--quiet/-q`.

---

## Memory & Project Docs

Codex merges Markdown instructions in this order:

1. `~/.codex/instructions.md` – personal global guidance
2. `codex.md` at repo root – shared project notes
3. `codex.md` in cwd – sub‑package specifics

Disable with `--no-project-doc` or `CODEX_DISABLE_PROJECT_DOC=1`.

---

## Non‑interactive / CI mode

Run Codex head‑less in pipelines. Example GitHub Action step:

```yaml
- name: Update changelog via Codex
  run: |
    npm install -g @openai/codex
    export OPENAI_API_KEY="${{ secrets.OPENAI_KEY }}"
    codex -a auto-edit --quiet "update CHANGELOG for next release"
```

Set `CODEX_QUIET_MODE=1` to silence interactive UI noise.

---

## FAQ

<details>
<summary>OpenAI released a model called Codex in 2021 - is this related?</summary>

In 2021, OpenAI released Codex, an AI system designed to generate code from natural language prompts. That original Codex model was deprecated as of March 2023 and is separate from the CLI tool.

</details>

<details>
<summary>How do I stop Codex from touching my repo?</summary>

Codex always runs in a **sandbox first**. If a proposed command or file change looks suspicious you can simply answer **n** when prompted and nothing happens to your working tree.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Does it work on Windows?</summary>

Not directly. It requires [Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL2)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) – Codex has been tested on macOS and Linux with Node ≥ 22.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Which models are supported?</summary>

Any model available with [Responses API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/responses). The default is `o4-mini`, but pass `--model gpt-4o` or set `model: gpt-4o` in your config file to override.

## Contributing

This project is under active development and the code will likely change pretty significantly. We'll update this message once that's complete!

More broadly we welcome contributions – whether you are opening your very first pull request or you’re a seasoned maintainer. At the same time we care about reliability and long‑term maintainability, so the bar for merging code is intentionally **high**. The guidelines below spell out what “high‑quality” means in practice and should make the whole process transparent and friendly.

### Development workflow

- Create a _topic branch_ from `main` – e.g. `feat/interactive-prompt`.
- Keep your changes focused. Multiple unrelated fixes should be opened as separate PRs.
- Use `npm run test:watch` during development for super‑fast feedback.
- We use **Vitest** for unit tests, **ESLint** + **Prettier** for style, and **TypeScript** for type‑checking.
- Before pushing, run the full test/type/lint suite:

  ```bash
  npm test && npm run lint && npm run typecheck
  ```

- If you have **not** yet signed the Contributor License Agreement (CLA), add a PR comment containing the exact text

  ```text
  I have read the CLA Document and I hereby sign the CLA
  ```

  The CLA‑Assistant bot will turn the PR status green once all authors have signed.

```bash
# Watch mode (tests rerun on change)
npm run test:watch

# Type‑check without emitting files
npm run typecheck

# Automatically fix lint + prettier issues
npm run lint:fix
npm run format:fix
```

### Writing high‑impact code changes

1. **Start with an issue.** Open a new one or comment on an existing discussion so we can agree on the solution before code is written.
2. **Add or update tests.** Every new feature or bug‑fix should come with test coverage that fails before your change and passes afterwards. 100 % coverage is not required, but aim for meaningful assertions.
3. **Document behaviour.** If your change affects user‑facing behaviour, update the README, inline help (`codex --help`), or relevant example projects.
4. **Keep commits atomic.** Each commit should compile and the tests should pass. This makes reviews and potential rollbacks easier.

### Opening a pull request

- Fill in the PR template (or include similar information) – **What? Why? How?**
- Run **all** checks locally (`npm test && npm run lint && npm run typecheck`). CI failures that could have been caught locally slow down the process.
- Make sure your branch is up‑to‑date with `main` and that you have resolved merge conflicts.
- Mark the PR as **Ready for review** only when you believe it is in a merge‑able state.

### Review process

1. One maintainer will be assigned as a primary reviewer.
2. We may ask for changes – please do not take this personally. We value the work, we just also value consistency and long‑term maintainability.
3. When there is consensus that the PR meets the bar, a maintainer will squash‑and‑merge.

### Community values

- **Be kind and inclusive.** Treat others with respect; we follow the [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/).
- **Assume good intent.** Written communication is hard – err on the side of generosity.
- **Teach & learn.** If you spot something confusing, open an issue or PR with improvements.

### Getting help

If you run into problems setting up the project, would like feedback on an idea, or just want to say _hi_ – please open a Discussion or jump into the relevant issue. We are happy to help.

Together we can make Codex CLI an incredible tool. **Happy hacking!** :rocket:

### Contributor License Agreement (CLA)

All contributors **must** accept the CLA. The process is lightweight:

1. Open your pull request.
2. Paste the following comment (or reply `recheck` if you’ve signed before):

   ```text
   I have read the CLA Document and I hereby sign the CLA
   ```

3. The CLA‑Assistant bot records your signature in the repo and marks the status check as passed.

No special Git commands, email attachments, or commit footers required.

#### Quick fixes

| Scenario          | Command                                                                                   |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Amend last commit | `git commit --amend -s --no-edit && git push -f`                                          |
| GitHub UI only    | Edit the commit message in the PR → add<br>`Signed-off-by: Your Name <email@example.com>` |

The **DCO check** blocks merges until every commit in the PR carries the footer (with squash this is just the one).

### Releasing `codex`

To publish a new version of the CLI, run the release scripts defined in `codex-cli/package.json`:

1. Open the `codex-cli` directory
2. Make sure you're on a branch like `git checkout -b bump-version`
3. Bump the version and `CLI_VERSION` to current datetime: `npm run release:version`
4. Commit the version bump (with DCO sign-off):
   ```bash
   git add codex-cli/src/utils/session.ts codex-cli/package.json
   git commit -s -m "chore(release): codex-cli v$(node -p \"require('./codex-cli/package.json').version\")"
   ```
5. Copy README, build, and publish to npm: `npm run release`
6. Push to branch: `git push origin HEAD`
